    <h1>Polish Japanese Academy of Information Technology</h1>
    <p>During the subsequent specialised instruction, students choose a major (area of specialisation) in which to further expand
        their knowledge and skills. Specialised classes are customised for each major; examples include programming in languages
         such as Prolog, ML, Assembler, C# or SQL. Furthermore, specialised instruction
         aims to build up the student’s team-working skills through, among others, implementation of specific projects.
